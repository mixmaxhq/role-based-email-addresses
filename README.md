## A list of role based email addresses

Common prefixes for "role-based" email addresses that represent a position, job, or group of people in the company rather than an individual. These were sourced from several places.

## Contributing

Please contribute. Just keep them in alphabetical order please (the "natural" order that calling `sort()` on the array would return).
